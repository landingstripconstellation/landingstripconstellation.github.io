				<h2 align="center">In Which Your Beloved LSC Wallows in Self-Pity and Self-Hatred While Making a Prancing Shit of Himself Trying to Justify the Existence of this Website</h2></br>
				<p>Last night I had trouble sleeping. I defaulted to my usual routine of cycling between listening to music slightly too loud, watching mind-numbing spirit-crushing youtube content about topics such as the history of 
				viral pornographic Animal Crossing memes, and practicing multitasking (masturbating and crying simultaneously (not really)). Somewhere in the soup of all this I had an idea that NO ONE HAS EVER HAD BEFORE. Start a
				hilarious online blog. Well to be completely honest, I think the idea was born more out of a megalomaniacal need to express myself than even the slightest hint of delusion that what I might have to say may really
				be meeting any kind of demand. </p>
				
				<p>I am 24 years old as of last year. I am an astrophysicist and a failed musician. I am a white man living in the undignified little shithole that is Ireland, referred to by former Taoiseach Enda Kenny as 
				'a great little country to do business in' which as I'm sure you can imagine fills me with a strong sense of national pride. I am autistic, but aside from that there is little to set me apart from the caldera of
				screaming lonely male voices on the internet. There is very little likelihood of anyone finding this site aside from the friends I judge trustworthy enough to know about it, but I will try and post thoughts here for my own amusement.
				Think of it as an experiment in recreating the kind of thing you may have found on the internet circa 2006.
				</p>
				
				<p>Today found your humble narrator in a great deal of world-weary anguish. I say world-weary anguish because it adds a layer of distance between myself, the blogger, and the actual things I was feeling. It would be more 
				accurate to say that this website's charming protagonist floated home from the shopping centre with a strong desire to hit himself in the face. Think I'm being hyperbolic? No, fuck you, as soon as I got home I proceeded
				to punch myself in the face repeatedly. That's you told and all ha ha ha.
				</p>
				
				<p>What distresses me most these days is all quite selfish. I concern myself mostly with introspective problems, the current one being a quick onset of guilt and shame following some hilarious drunken antics of mine. 
				I have a tendency at even the best of times to completely take leave of my senses when I've gotten drunk, which I do often and in this particular case my actions while probably not that affecting to the people around me
				at least in their own minds have left me ashamed to be alive. Not necessarily because of any tangible reason other than it has pushed the precedent to the point that when I look at everything I've ever done in my 
				most unguarded moments the only conclusion that I can possibly reach is that I am simply not a good person.</p>
				
				<p>Well that was rather joyful wasn't it? More to follow :D</p>
				<p>Ooh and today's song is 'I Don't Remember' off Peter Gabriel's third self-titled album. Used to listen to that a lot on the way to work when I had a particularly shitty job.</p>
